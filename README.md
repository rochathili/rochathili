# Hey there! I'm Thiago Rocha Lira. Welcome to my profile!

## About Me
I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Ipiranga in SÃ£o Paulo and been in love with computers since I was a child, recently just got out of my job teaching entry level web-development (HTML, CSS, JS and Git/GitHub) at an NGO.
My new found love for Fedora + GNOME is enticing me to explore the world of Linux and open-source software, and I am excited to learn more about programming and software development. This might make me study C and Rust in the future, but right now I am focusing on learning Java and OOP for my career and parity with the school's curriculum.

I'd love to help with anything open-source related! Specially translations and documentation for Brazilian Portuguese.

## Currently focusing on developing skills in:
- Java
- OOP
- Software Development
